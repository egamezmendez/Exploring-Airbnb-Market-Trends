# Exploring Airbnb Market Trends
Welcome to New York City, one of the most-visited cities in the world. There are many Airbnb listings in New York City for travelers, which can be anywhere between a few nights to many months. In this project, we will take a closer look at the New York Airbnb market by combining data from multiple file types like .csv, .tsv, and .xlsx.

Recall that CSV, TSV, and Excel files are three common formats for storing data. Three files containing data on 2019 Airbnb listings are available to you:

data/airbnb_price.csv This is a CSV file containing data on Airbnb listing prices and locations.

data/airbnb_room_type.xlsx: this is an Excel file containing data on Airbnb listing descriptions and room types.

data/airbnb_last_review.tsv: this is a TSV file containing data on Airbnb host names and review dates.

listing_id: unique identifier of listing
price: nightly listing price in USD
nbhood_full: name of borough and neighborhood where listing is located
data/airbnb_room_type.xlsx This is an Excel file containing data on Airbnb listing descriptions and room types.

listing_id: unique identifier of listing
description: listing description
room_type: Airbnb has three types of rooms: shared rooms, private rooms, and entire homes/apartments
data/airbnb_last_review.tsv This is a TSV file containing data on Airbnb host names and review dates.

listing_id: unique identifier of listing
host_name: name of listing host
last_review: date when the listing was last reviewed


We will be answering the following questions:

What are the dates of the earliest and most recent reviews?

How many of the listings are private rooms?

What is the average listing price?
